Project Description
“What should I do when I grow up?” is one of the most frequently-asked questions for every child. However, during our explorations of our dream careers as children, we would receive a lot of comments from adults. Based on whether positive or negative, these comments could have very influential effects on a child’s growth path. Sometimes, a encouragement is all it takes to step further in your dream while a simple negative feedback may hold you back. The project is meant to help you realize the significance of such feedbacks while simultaneously reflecting on how to view these opinions critically in order to persist in your own choice.
The “Dream Simulator” will try to relate the personal experience of its users by asking for users’ personal information in the beginning such as their name, dream career, and pictures. However, instead of experiencing the dream in first-person perspective, the user will play the role of “advisor” in this scenario by giving emotionally one-sided feedback to the main character, a child with user’s name and dream, in the project. By analyzing the sentiment tendency of user’s input, the Dream Simulator will decide the storyline of the career development of the main character. For example, if the user continuously leave positive encouragements and supports, the storyline will be in favor of the main character’s pursuit of his dream while it is possible the character didn't even give a try to his dream as a result of too many negative influences.
“Dream Simulator” is a program developed in Java code that involves inputting using text console and producing graphical visual results. The program will present itself as the storywriter in the development of the story. But, the Simulator will ask user’s opinion to decide its direction in the storyline based on user’s sentiment. This is done by searching two lists of positive and negative words respectively and try to match user’s feedback with words in those lists. The lists come from Minqing Hu and Bing Liu as shown in reference section.
By providing the opportunity to experience their dream from a “commenter” perspective, the Dream Simulator wants to address the significance of other’s opinions on a child’s dream. After simulating multiple results with feedback of different opinions, the user is meant to learn about the importance of being supportive and encouraging.  However, in a meta perspective, the project also wants to address the importance of believing in one’s own choice and view outside feedback critically. The project wants to make the user to realize this point by erasing all the storyline and comments with a questions asking “Are you on track of pursuing you dream, [User Name]? ”
